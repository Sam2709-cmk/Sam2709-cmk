# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load historical football data (adjust the file path accordingly)
data = pd.read_csv('historical_football_data.csv')

# Perform feature engineering
# ... (include relevant features and preprocess data)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize a RandomForestClassifier (you can experiment with other models)
model = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# Now you can use the trained model to make predictions on new data
# new_data = pd.read_csv('new_data.csv')
# new_predictions = model.predict(new_data)
